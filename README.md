# Hello ðŸ‘‹ , I'm Angelyn. 

### I enjoy coding and am fascinated by what software engineers can do. I hope to be able to contribute to my community using my coding skills.

- ðŸŒ±  My main stack: HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, NodeJS, and Python. My work-in-progress portfolio is www.angelynaliem.com
- âš¡  Fun fact: I love learning and one of the best things about having kids is that I get to re-learn what I wish I had learned better when I was little. I also get to learn and play a bunch of new and cool games like Bakugan and Pokemon.
