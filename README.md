# Hello 👋 , I'm Angelyn. 

### I am currently learning Full Stack Web Development at Lambda School. I enjoy coding and am fascinated by what software engineers can do. I hope to soon be able to contribute to my community using my coding skills.

- 🌱  I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Node, and Python
- ⚡  Fun fact: My most enjoyable time during coding school is when I was doing state management using Redux! I also make pretty good cinnamon buns.
